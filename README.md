# ENGSCI 263  - Rotarua Geothermal System Recovery

## Project Overview
For this project, our aim was to develop a computer model to analyse the pressure and temperature changes in the Rotorua geothermal field, providing insights as to the recovery of the Waikite geyser's surface features.

## Included Files
***Benchmarking.py***
  * This file consists of code we used to generate plots for our benchmarks

***ODE_Model_Function.py***
  * This file includes code we used to develop our forecasts for both pressure & temperature and also generate the misfit

***poetry.lock & pyproject.toml***
  * These files contains details of the dependancies and their version numbers required to execute our code

***test_functions.py***
  * This file includes the unit tests we have developed to ensure that our model is working as intended

***visualisations.py***
  * This file contains the code for the plot we used to visualise all the data provided to us

The purpose of this lab is to meet your group members and to become familiarwith the first project:  a resource consent.  The discussions today will serve asa starting point for the first group assessment, which is the modelling designproposal.

### Activities
1.  Find your group members and share contact details with each other.
2.  Set  up  a  git  repository  for  your  project  and  invite  all  team  mem-bers1.(Forgotten  how  to  set  up  a  git  repository?   ReviewqclabunderFiles/cm/engsci233  on  the  ENGSCI263  Canvas  page.   You  may  need  toopenGit CMDfrom the Start menu to getgitcommands working.)

You will be assigned a hypothetical resource consent as your project scenario.Start by downloading the corresponding data pack from the Canvas link andcommit the data files to the repository.  Referring to Section 2 of the ModelDesign notes, discuss within your group:

3. **Why?** – What is the problem?  Who are the stakeholders and whatdo they want?  What outcomes of the resource consent are possible?
4. **How?** – Try to identify where and how a computer model could beuseful.
5. **Given?** – What data have you been given?  What data do you thinkyou will need to look up?
6. **Assume?** - Discuss  and  develop  within  your  group  a  conceptualmodel  for  your  problem.   Identify  what  you  think  are  themostim-portant  physics.   Brainstorm  the  possible  model  domain,  initial  andboundary conditions, and important parameters.

After  45  minutes,  I  will  ask  each  group  to  present  the **Why?,How?,Given?, andAssume?**.  Discuss your proposed conceptual model, while agroup member sketches it on the whiteboard.  Everybody should contributeto the presentation.  Try and nominate one topic per person.

### Modelling design proposal
The first group assignment, due at the beginning of Week 3, is themodeldesign proposal.  This short report, written by your group, should describethe problem and how you intend to address it through computer modelling.You should meet regularly with your group to progress these assignments.Delegate tasks to pairs or individuals and try to balance the workload.  Ifsomeone  is  not  pulling  their  weight,  let  them  know  directly  as  they  oftenwon’t be aware they’re not meeting expectations.  Serious group dysfunctionshould be reported to the course coordinator (j.fernandez@auckland.ac.nz).

### Assessment
Assessment of this lab is participation based.  All you have to do is show upand contribute to your group’s discussion and presentation of their scenario.This lab is worth 1% of your final grade.
